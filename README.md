  <h1>Introduction to Github</h1>
  <p>Github is one of the largest companies which fosters a community of open-source developers around the planet!</p>
</div>
<br>
<div align="center">
<h2>Foreword</h2>
</div>
<p>Github is the largest platform of free and open-source software. Many people and companies use it to improve their collaboration and workflow. This guide will show you how to commit files and suggest changes with a pull request! Hopefully, you'll learn how to use Github and learn about some of its history too!</p>
<br>
<p>Below is my three part introduction to Github, from it's history to the creation of commits and pull requests. This should only take fifteen minutes! So, strap in and lets blast off!</p>

  <summary><h2>Welcome to Github</h2></summary>
  <p>Welcome to my <i>'Introduction of Github'</i>! üëã</p>
  <b>What is Github?</b>
  <p>Github is a service which was founded in 2008, by a group of four developers. It quickly grew and in 2011, there was over one million public repositories!</p><p>Then in 2015, the company was worth $1 billion USD! Tehn in 2018, Microsoft acquired the company for $7.5 billion USD.</p>
  <p>Did you know that Github is actually based on Git! Which was made by Linus Torvalds for the Linux kernel. Git is a distributed, version control program which gives a copy of the project to all of the developers and allows them to safely commit to the project with branches.</p>
  <p>Although, Github now fosters the open source community. This is due to the easy of contributing and hosting software on Github. It also hosts the most open-source software!</p>

  <br>
  <b>What is a repository?</b>
  <p>A repository is a container for your projects files and folders, and branches. It will also track versions of your files too!</p>

  <br>
  <b>What is a branch?</b>
  <p>A branch is a parallel copy of your <code>main</code> branch. It allows you to commit edits and preview them, then you can create a pull request to merge it to the live branch.</p>

  <br>
  <b>What is a pull request?</b>
  <p>A pull request is a request you can make which suggests merging a branch with the <code>main</code> branch. They can only be approved by the repository's collaborators or owner(s).</p>

  <summary><h2>Creating a Branch</h2></summary>
  <p>Hopefully you have a basic understanding about what Github is! üéâ</p>
  <b>How do I make a branch?</b>
  <p>As I mentioned, to safely commit changes, you should create a new branch. Then make a pull request (which I'll cover later). It's pretty simple to create a branch, I've put some simple steps below, with pictures as well!</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Find the Branch Button üîç</h3>
  <p>Go to your repository's landing page and navigate to the branch button, which when it's clicked it will show a nifty drop-down menu!</p>

  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>Click the Branch Button üñ±Ô∏è</h3>
  <p>Once you've found the button, click it. Then this drop-down will pop out! It will show your current branches.</p>

  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>Enter the Name of Your New Branch ‚å®Ô∏è</h3>
  <p>When you've opened the drop-down, you can enter the name for your new branch. Then click the button which says, 'Create branch <code>name</code> from <code>main</code>'.</p>

  <summary><h2>Commiting Files</h2></summary>
  <p>So, you're branching out (all puns intended)! ü™¥</p>
  <b>How do I commit files to a branch?</b>
  <p>Commiting files is super easy, and very similar to making a branch. Again, I've put simple steps and pictures below!</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Find the 'Add file' Button üîç</h3>
  <p>Again, go to your repository's landing page and find the 'Add file' button, then when it's clicked it will show a menu with the options to create or upload a file.</p>

  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>Click the 'Create new file' or 'Upload files' Button üëÜ</h3>
  <p>Once you click the 'Add file' button, a drop-down menu will pop out and there will be two new buttons which allow you to commit files.</p>

  <br>
  <h3>Click One of the Add Options ‚úíÔ∏è</h3>
  <p>Depending on which option you chose to add a file, you will either have to write code in the window, or you'll have to upload a file from your computer. Then commit the file.</p>
