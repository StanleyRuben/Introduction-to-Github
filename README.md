<summary><h2>Welcome to Github!</h2></summary>
<b>What is Github?</b><p>Github is a service, which was founded in 2008. It is based on Git which is a distributed version control system. It was also made by Linus Torvalds for the Linux kernel!</p>
<p>Although, now it is a pillar of the FOSS community. This is due to the easy of contributing and hosting open-source software on Github! The definition of 'Open-source' is: 'A project which has it's source code available to the public'.</p>
